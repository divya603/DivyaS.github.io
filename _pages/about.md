I'm a graduate student at New York University.

I am currently working on my Master's Thesis under [Professor Todd Gureckis](https://todd.gureckislab.org/) at the [Computation and Cognition Lab](https://gureckislab.org/). I study how the timing and quantity of testimony affect its integration with direct experience.Specifically, I aim to explore how individuals or agents integrate social and experiential information, particularly when these sources are introduced at different times or come into conflict.  

I gained a solid foundation in computer science during my undergraduate studies at Shiv Nadar University through a combination of coursework and projects. My thesis was advised by Professor Joannes Same Mertens from The University of Catania where I designed deep learning pipelines using CNN and LSTM autoencoders to capture temporal driving patterns and behavioral signatures from raw sensor data, enabling robust profiling of individual drivers across identical driving conditions.

Outside of academics, I love crocheting. Sometimes, I feel there’s a little old lady living inside me who just wants to sit by a window and crochet all day.

I’m also on a personal quest to find the best hot fudge out there, because priorities. So far, the top spot goes to the hot fudge from [What’s the Scoop](https://whatsthescoopmetuchen.com/), but the search (happily) continues.
