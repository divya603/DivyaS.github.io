This project explores cooperative behavior in a multi-agent environment, combining empirical data analysis with computational modeling to understand decision-making dynamics.

### Highlights:
- **Data Source:** Leveraged experimental data from a multi-agent environment (58,882 interactions).
- **Agent Simulation:** Modeled agent populations with varying reciprocity predispositions using logistic regression.
- **Features:** Key predictors included partner helping history and spatial proximity to resources.
- **Results:**
  - High accuracy in predicting helping behavior.
  - Diverse agent behaviors reflect real-world reciprocity dynamics.
  - Explored the impact of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors on game outcomes.

### Contributions:
- Designed a novel agent generation process simulating individual variability in helping predispositions.
- Developed a logistic regression model for analyzing helping behavior predictors.
- Highlighted implications for cooperative strategies in dynamic environments.
