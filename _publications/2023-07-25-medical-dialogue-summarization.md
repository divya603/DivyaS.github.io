This paper explores medical dialogue summarization using a linear support vector classification technique. The study focuses on accurately identifying topics within doctor-patient conversations to streamline clinical documentation. Using a machine learning pipeline, snippets of medical dialogue were classified into predefined section headers such as "Assessment," "Diagnosis," and "Past Medical History." 

Key features of the approach include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Removing digits, punctuation, and stopwords for clean text input.
- **Modeling:** Training a Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with random oversampling to address class imbalances.
- **Validation:** Demonstrating effectiveness on unseen test data, showcasing practical applications in organizing and summarizing clinical notes.

The research was presented at **CLEF 2023** in Thessaloniki, Greece.
