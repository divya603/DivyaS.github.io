This paper discusses driving style profiling using deep auto-encoders to enhance safety in urban and highway scenarios. The proposed method leverages sensor data from vehicles to create unique driving profiles, using advanced techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By analyzing temporal dependencies and deviations from standard driving behaviors, the approach aims to improve vehicular safety across diverse scenarios.
