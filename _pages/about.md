👩‍🎓 I'm a graduate student at New York University.

🔬 I am deeply passionate about leveraging Machine Learning to transform healthcare and make it more accessible and efficient. My focus lies in exploring computer vision projects that bridge the gap between technology and medical applications.

💡In particular, I am fascinated by image detection and classification tasks that can streamline disease diagnosis, enabling faster and more accurate detection of critical conditions. By developing intelligent systems that analyze medical imagery, such as X-rays, MRIs, and pathology slides, I aim to contribute to the creation of tools that empower healthcare professionals and improve patient outcomes.

My vision is to harness the power of ML and AI to simplify complex processes in healthcare, ultimately making medical care more effective and widely available.

📚 My academic journey and hands-on experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in software engineering, particularly in designing and building reliable systems. Throughout my coursework, I have explored areas such as algorithms, cognitive modeling, and machine learning, which have deepened my understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. My recent coursework has focused on cognitive modeling, which provided me insights into how computational approaches can enhance data-driven decision-making.
